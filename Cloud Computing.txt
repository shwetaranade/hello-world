Cloud computing features
1.Virtualization-(ability to increase computing efficiency) ex. running multiple pseudo ex. email server, web server, db server servers on one physical server
division of single physical server into multiple virtual servers

2. pay as you go
ex. testing oracle on windows, testing oracle on windows

3.reduced cost
no need to invest in infra and maintainance.

4.moving IT responsiblity to third party.
focus on the core business and hand over infra management to experts.

Cloud computing is multi-tenant i.e to seperate data


5.bringing enterprise scale infra to small and medium business
hardware software licenses,administration cost but with cloud computing a server can be capable of running business appls which can be rented for 11 $(subsription)

scalablity and fast provisioning
ex. flipcart sales surge during festive season, millions of users make transactions.

Cloud is collection of services
SaaS
web access to commercial software, users are not required to handle software upgrades and patches
Ex.Google services Google apps, office 365, Gmail,dropbox, webex, goto meeting
where is SaaS used?vanilla offering, ex email
demand spikes significatly, billing software

PaaS
Salesforce, Azure by microsoft or Amazon web services 
quickly develop test and deploy

Iaas
demand on infrastructure is voltile, start ups which do not want to invest in expensive hardware, where scaling H/W will be a problem
Ex, Rackspace, Amazon webservices, HP

IaaS Public cloud vs private cloud
Public cloud-shared infrastructure resources over internet for scaling requirements ex Amazon,IBM,Google

Private cloud -uses private network, where organizations use their own hardware or hardware of a third party.hardware is dedicated and no sharing of infrastructure between users

Hybrid Cloud
Virtual private cloud-single customer but scalable
cloud bursting-company uses its own infrastructure and at peak events will pass to public cloud utilizing the scaling feature of public cloud
